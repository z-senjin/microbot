  - **Notification System**
    - Discord/Telegram integration for completion notifications
    - Configurable alerts based on success/failure states
    - Detailed reports on resources gathered, skills gained, etc.

- **Graceful Stopping Support**
  - **State Persistence Framework  - Just an Idea**
    - Save critical state during interruptions
    - Resume capability from last known good state (location,...)
    - Progress tracking with persistent checkpoints
  - **Safety Mechanism Implementations**
    - Transition to safe areas before stopping
    - Complete partial operations before full shutdown
    - Banking valuable items before exit


### Plugin Integration

- **Existing Plugins**
  - Convert popular plugins to use the scheduling framework
  - Update woodcutting, mining, and fishing plugins with schedulable support
  - Implement combat scripts with safety condition integration

### UI Enhancements

- **Schedule Management GUI**
  - Visual timeline showing planned plugin execution
  - Better Conflict detection and resolution for overlapping schedules
  - Schedule templates and sharing capability
  - Improve Condition visualization and editing tools


## Long-term Enhancements

### Advanced Condition Framework

- **Machine Learning Integration**
  - Train models to recognize optimal stopping conditions
  - Implement predictive scheduling based on historical performance
  - Auto-adjust parameters based on success/failure patterns

- **Extended Condition Types**
  - **Market Conditions**
    - Start/stop based on Grand Exchange prices
    - Algorithmic trading strategies with configurable parameters
    - Support for price trend detection and forecasting
  - **Server Conditions**
    - Player density monitoring to avoid crowded areas
    - World-hopping integration based on optimal conditions
    - Server performance metrics to avoid high-lag situations
  - **Account Progression Conditions**

- **Community Integration**
  - Schedule sharing platform for common tasks
  - Upvoting system for effective condition combinations
  - Community benchmarks for plugin performance

### Ecosystem Extensions

- **Integration with External Tools**
  - Prayer/HP monitoring via companion services
  - Network condition monitoring for stability
  - Anti-ban pattern enhancements through scheduling variability

- **Environment-aware Scheduling**
  - Adapt to in-game events and seasonal activities
  - Dynamic resource targeting based on current game economy
  - Account-specific optimization based on stats and equipment

## Implementation Approach

The development will follow an iterative approach, with regular releases that incrementally add functionality. Community feedback will be actively sought after each significant feature addition to ensure the system meets real-world needs.

Priority will be given to features that:
1. Improve stability and reliability
2. Enhance user experience for non-technical players
3. Provide valuable automation to complex multi-step tasks
4. Support intelligent decision-making based on game state

This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback, game updates, and shifting priorities within the development team.
